Here's an example of how the `data.json` file might look:

```json
{
  "A": ["Name 1", "Name 2", "Name 3"],
  "B": ["Name 4", "Name 5"],
  "C": ["Name 6", "Name 7", "Name 8", "Name 9"],
  "D": ["Name 10"]
}
```

This JSON file contains four lists (A, B, C, D), each with a few names. You can update this file according to the names added or moved in your PHP program.
